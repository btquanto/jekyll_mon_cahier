# Usage

Jekyll Mon Cahier provides a full Jekyll setup. There are some usage options:

## Using github pages

* Fork this repo to your github account
* Rename the repo to `<username>.github.io`. Your site will be available at `<username>.github.io`
* If you want a custom domain, create a CNAME record and point it to `<username>.github.io`, then add your custom domain in the `CNAME` file.

## Using Jekyll server

* Install Jekyll server (ruby is required)
    ```
    gem install jekyll
    ```
* Serve the site
    ```
    jekyll serve
    ```
* Open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), and there it is

## Using docker

* Install docker by following instructions on [Docker's website](https://docker.io/). Make sure all necessary gems are installed as well ()
* Use docker to serve your site.
    I am using [btquanto/docker-jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/btquanto/docker-jekyll/) docker image.
    ```
    docker run -d --name jekyll \
        -v `pwd`:/src \
        -p 4000:4000 \
        btquanto/docker-jekyll jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 --drafts
    ```
    The [grahamc/jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/grahamc/jekyll/) works as well, but the image size is much bigger (816.4MB in comparison to 226.5MB).
    ```
    docker run -d --name jekyll \
        -v `pwd`:/src \
        -p 4000:4000 \
        grahamc/jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 --drafts
    ```
    I prepared a `docker-compose.yml` file, so you can also install and use `docker-compose`. It by default uses the [btquanto/docker-jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/btquanto/docker-jekyll/) image
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
